Description:
&amp;ldquo;Seeker of Knowledge&amp;rdquo;. That is how I describe myself. Granddaughter of Japanese immigrants, I was born in Brazil, and since a very young age I have always been interested in learning new things. That is why I spent almost 2 years in Germany, exploring a new culture and learning a different approach to the studying process, the protection of the environment and social studies.</description></item></channel></rss>
